# HOUSEPRICEPREDICTION
This is the code for the implementation of a Random Forest Algorithm model for house price prediction. The algorithm was built using 
Google Colab and then exported as a .py file. The dataset is the housing-data-full file. It is an excel file containing over 2900 houses with individual atributes and sale prices. 
The code file name is Random Forest model for house price predictions.py. And there is a python notebook file to work more seamlessly with google colab or with the jupyter notebook. The only thing needed to be done is to replace the file path to make sure that the model runs.


Thank you
